/**
 * This class simplifies communication between the main thread and worker
 * threads by encapsulating their communication protocol into a single class
 * that can be used on both ends of the channel.
 * 
 * To send a message to a worker, create an instance of this class and then call
 * `message.send( worker )`.  To send a message from a worker, create an
 * instance and call `message.send()` (which therefore just goes "out").  In the
 * message event handler on either end, you can construct a new `Message`
 * instance from the event itself, and its data will be extracted appropriately.
 * For example, the {@link module:ValidationWorker validation worker} has code
 * something like this:
 * 
 * ```js
 * addEventListener( 'message', event => {
 *     const message = new Message( event )
 *     if ( message.is( 'putdown' ) ) { // check type
 *         const putdown = message.get( 'putdown' ) // read message content
 *         // validate document sent in putdown format
 *     } else {
 *         // send error message because we expected putdown
 *     }
 * } )
 * ```
 * 
 * Having one class that's imported into both the main thread and the worker
 * means not dividing the communication protocol code over multiple files, and
 * thus improving consistency and reducing chances of logic errors.
 * 
 * There are also some static members that make certain message-sending
 * operations more concise and readable; see below.

     *       expressions and environments to this expression
     *     - `'scoping'`, meaning the scopes of variables, including
     *       declarations and the lack thereof
     *     - `'instantiation'`, or what the LDE calls "basic instantiation
     *       hints" (BIHs)
     *     - `'error'`, meaning an internal error took place in the LDE or the
     *       communication with the LDE
     *  - `result` - a human-readable string that is one of three possible
     *    values: `'valid'`, `'invalid'`, or `'indeterminate'`, meaning,
     *    respectively, correct work, incorrect work, and work that may or may
     *    not be correct, but the LDE doesn't have enough information; these
     *    correspond to the types of icons shown in the UI, respectively, green,
     *    red, and yellow
     *  - `reason` - a human-readable string that is short enough to show in a
     *    pop-up message when hovering over the validation icon in the UI.  In
     *    fact, this string is not only human-readable, but written in a simple
     *    and informal style that we aim to be natural and simple for students
     *    to read.
     *  - `code` - a brief, English summary of the feedback, from which most of
     *    the rest of the data could be deduced.  Examples include:
     *     - `'undeclared variable'` (or more than one undeclared variables)
     *     - `'redeclared variable'` (or more than one redeclared variables)
     *     - `'valid inference'`
     *     - `'indeterminate inference'`
     *     - `'invalid inference'`
     *     - `'valid instantiation'`
     *     - `'invalid instantiation'` (for now, there are no indeterminate
     *       instantiations)
     *     - `'error'` (for now, all errors are lumped into one category)
