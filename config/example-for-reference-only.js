     * 
     * First, there are those built into TinyMCE, which you can find here:
     * https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/available-menu-items/#the-core-menu-items
     * 
     * Second, there are those built into Lurch, which are listed here:
     *  - aboutlurch
     *  - clearvalidation
     *  - deletesaved
     *  - docsettings
     *  - downloaddocumentcode
     *  - editdependencyurls
     *  - embeddocument
     *  - embedheader
     *  - enviroment
     *  - exportlatex
     *  - expositorymath
     *  - expression
     *  - extractheader
     *  - newlurchdocument
     *  - opendocument
     *  - paragraphabove
     *  - paragraphbelow
     *  - preferences
     *  - redpen

     *  - togglemeaning
     *  - validate
     *  - viewdependencyurls
     *  - viewdocumentascode
     * 
     * The "menuData" section is an object whose keys are the names of the
     * menus, and whose values are object with "title" and "items" fields, the
     * latter of which are strings containing the names of the items in that
     * menu, separated by spaces, with a "|" character indicating menu
     * separators.  The following example shows one way you might configure the
     * menus, but there are plenty of other menu items available, listed in the
