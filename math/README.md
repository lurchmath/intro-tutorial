# Mathematical documents folder

If you make a copy of this repository to use as the basis for your own Lurch
Site, you can fill this folder with the relevant mathematical documents for your
site.

To learn how to to so, check out
[How to Create a Lurch Site](https://lurchmath.github.io/site/how-to-create-a-lurch-site/).

By default, this folder is empty, because this is the development repository.
It is not the repository for any instructor's Lurch Site, but rather the
repository where we build the app itself.
