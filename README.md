# Minimalist Lurch Site

For an explanation of the Lurch project in general, see
[the project website](http://lurchmath.github.io).

This repository is a fork of the main Lurch repository, but with all developer
tools removed.  It makes a great starting point for creating a Lurch Site (that
is, your own copy of Lurch, configured how you need for your course, hosted on
GitHub's web space).  To see how to create a Lurch Site, refer to
[our documentation on that topic](https://lurchmath.github.io/site/how-to-create-a-lurch-site/).
