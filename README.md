# Lurch

[Project website](http://lurchmath.github.io).

This repository is the central location for the latest version of the Lurch
project. It was formed from the union of three smaller repositories, now housed
in the `core`, `engine`, and `app` folders of this repository.  For that reason,
you might find some pieces of the documentation that haven't yet been updated
to account for the fact that we have merged everything into one repository, but
that will improve with time.

This repository serves two purposes:

 1. The developers of the Lurch project work in this repository, and anyone who
    is interested in browsing or improving the app code can work here as well.
 2. It is possible to use this repository to create your own Lurch Site, which
    is a website hosting an instance of the Lurch app that you have configured
    for your own needs (or the needs of your students).  To learn how, check out
    [How to Create a Lurch Site](https://lurchmath.github.io/site/how-to-create-a-lurch-site/).
